First of all, copy the configuration into your httpd.conf file, or the vhost file associated.
Don't forget to replace the path to your project's public directory. 
Take care to keep the / at the end of the DocumentRoot line and remove it at the end the for <Directory> line.

###### Start copy here
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName zfm
    DocumentRoot /path/to/your/project/public/
 
    SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV "production"
 
    <Directory /path/to/your/project/public>
        DirectoryIndex index.php
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
##### Stop copy here

Restart your webserver.

Then go to your hosts file the one for your OS,
- on windows it's in probably in "/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts", 
- on unix it's in probably in "/etc/hosts"

Edit it with your favorite text editor and add the following line :
127.0.0.1     zfm
